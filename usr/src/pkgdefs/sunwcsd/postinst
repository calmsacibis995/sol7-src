# The following /devices entries are no longer in the SUNWcsd package:
# 	qe, be, hme
#	rts, smc
#
# They are created in the postinstall script of the SUWNcsr package.
#
#  The devices/pseudo entries for any new clone drivers that are needed
#  for initial boot of Solaris are now created in this postinstall
#  script rather than in the SUNWcsd package.  To create the 
#  devices/pseudo entry for a new clone device, add it to the DRIVERS variable.
#  This method is primarily intended for drivers transitioning from
#  unbundled to bundled with Solaris.
