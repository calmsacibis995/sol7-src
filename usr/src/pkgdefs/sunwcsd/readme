The devices/psuedo entries for the drivers qe, be, and hme have been
removed from the SUNWcsd package.  They are now generated by the
postinstall script in the SUNWcsr package.  This was done to fix the
bugs 1218627, 1255198 and 1245614.

The above fix has been extended to include rts, smc
drivers as well (bugs 4022790 & 4015251)
