# Postinstall script for mibii daemon package
#
 
#
# This part is different from the SNM 2.3 revB FCS version.
# We do not want to set up any rc startup file for mibiisa.
# That gets handled by the pkgadd of SUNWsacom, which does the startup.
# mibiisa gets spawned as a child process of snmpdx,
# which will use its own configuration file.
# Do not start the mibiisa here.
# Do not kill off any existing snmpd here.
# They already gave the ok to get here in the request file
# before the execution of this postinstall script.
